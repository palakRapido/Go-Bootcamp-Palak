# Go Boot Camp

A Go project created for learning and development.

## Project Structure

```
goBootCamp/
├── go.mod          # Go module file
├── main.go         # Main application entry point
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher installed on your system

### Running the Application

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Building the Application

```bash
go build
```

This will create an executable named `goBootCamp` in the current directory.

### Running the Built Executable

```bash
./goBootCamp
```

## Development

Add your Go code to this project. You can:
- Create additional `.go` files in the same package
- Create new packages in subdirectories
- Add dependencies using `go get <package-name>`

## Common Commands

- `go run main.go` - Run the application without building
- `go build` - Build the executable
- `go test` - Run tests
- `go mod tidy` - Clean up dependencies
- `go get <package>` - Add a new dependency
